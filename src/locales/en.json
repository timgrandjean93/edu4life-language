      "instruction": "People cleared forests, transformed the floodplains into pastures and crop fields, and built villages and later cities near the banks of the Danube. To protect themselves from floods, they constructed dikes. The Danube was also developed as a navigational waterway and for hydropower production. As a result, the river lost many of its natural features: the balance of sediments in the riverbed was disturbed, and the connection between the river channel and its floodplains was largely cut off. Only a few remnants of the original floodplain remained, while many typical animals and plants disappeared."

      "instruction": "Step by step, parts of the Danube floodplain are being reconnected to the river. Old side arms are reopened, forests and wetlands are restored, and natural flooding is allowed again wherever possible. These measures bring back habitats for fish, birds, and plants, while also helping people — by storing floodwaters, improving water quality, providing water during droughts, and offering space for recreation. These restoration Measures are called Nature-based Solution."
